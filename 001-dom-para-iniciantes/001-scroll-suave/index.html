        <h2>Fox</h2>
        <p>Foxes are small to medium sized carnivorous mammals belonging to the Canidae family, which also includes wolves, jackals, and coyotes. There are 37 species of fox, and only 12 of these are true foxes. Foxes are found on every continent except Antarctica. The fox is most closely related to the dog, and is thought to have evolved from a common ancestor about 10 million years ago.</p>
        <p>The typical fox has a reddish brown coat, white underparts, and a black-tipped tail. The muzzle is long and pointed, and the ears are large and pointy. The legs are relatively short, and the front paws have five toes, while the back paws have only four.</p>
        <p>They are generally nocturnal animals, although there are some exceptions. They are very agile, and can climb trees and fences with ease. Foxes are good swimmers, and can run up to 30 miles per hour.</p>
        <p>Apart of being solitary animals, they will sometimes form pairs or small families. The average lifespan of a fox is about 3-4 years in the wild, but they can live up to 10 years in captivity.</p>

        <h2>Squirrel</h2>
        <p>The squirrels are a group of rodents consisting of small to medium-sized species. They are native to all continents except for Australia and Antarctica. Squirrels are typically arboreal, but some ground-dwelling species exist.</p>
        <p>There are over 200 species of squirrels, including the red squirrel, chipmunk, flying squirrel, and prairie dog. They are generally small to medium in size, with most species ranging from 10 to 20 cm in length. The largest squirrel is the giant squirrel, which can grow up to 1 m in length.</p>
        <p>Squirrels are omnivorous, and their diet consists of a variety of plant and animal matter. They are known to eat nuts, seeds, fruits, insects, and even small birds or mammals. In some cases, they have been known to raid human dwellings in search of food.</p>
        <p>Generally diurnal, but there are some species that are active at night. They are also very good climbers, and can often be seen running up and down trees. They play an important role in the dispersal of plant seeds, as they often cache surplus food in the ground for later consumption. This behaviour helps to spread plants into new areas.</p>

        <h2>Bear</h2>
        <p>Bears are large, mammalian predators that are found in the forests of North America, Europe, and Asia. There are eight different species of bears, including the polar bear, grizzly bear, and black bear. Bears are typically solitary animals, except for mothers and cubs, and are known for their strength, agility, and ferocity.</p>
        <p>With thick fur coats that help protect them from the cold weather and keep them warm in their dens during the winter months. They also have sharp claws and teeth that they use for hunting and self-defense. Bears are omnivores, meaning that they eat both plants and animals. Their diet consists of berries, nuts, roots, insects, fish, and small mammals.</p>
        <p>Bears are generally shy and avoid contact with humans. However, they can be dangerous if they feel threatened or if they are protecting their cubs. If you see a bear in the wild, it is important to stay calm and avoid making any sudden movements. If a bear does approach you, try to make yourself as small as possible and back away slowly. Never run from a bear, as this will only trigger their natural instinct to chase and catch prey.</p>

        <h2>Wolf</h2>
        <p>There are many different types of wolves, but the most common is the gray wolf. Wolves are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain. They are also highly intelligent animals and have complex social structures.</p>
        <p>Known for their howling, which they use to communicate with other members of their pack. Howling can also be used to warn off other packs or predators. Wolves are generally shy around humans, but there have been instances of them attacking people. This usually happens when they are starving or feel threatened.</p>
        <p>Wolves play an important role in the ecosystem. They help to keep populations of other animals in check, which can help to prevent overgrazing and other problems. Wolves also help to keep predators like coyotes and foxes in check.</p>
        <p>The main threat to wolves is habitat loss. As humans continue to encroach on their territory, wolves are losing the places they need to live and hunt. This can lead to conflict with humans, as well as competition for food. Hunting and trapping also pose a threat to wolves.</p>
        <p>Despite these threats, wolves are still found in many parts of the world. With proper management and conservation efforts, their populations can be maintained.</p>

        <h2>Baboon</h2>
        <p>Baboons are large, terrestrial monkeys that arenative to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The five species of baboons are the hamadryas baboon, the Guinea baboon, the olive baboon, the yellow baboon, and the chacma baboon. Baboons are intelligent and social animals, and live in troops of up to several hundred individuals.</p>
        <p>They have long been considered pests by farmers, as they will raid crops and kill livestock. In recent years, however, some farmers have begun to see the potential benefits of baboons, and are now working to create "baboon-friendly" farms.</p>
        <p>Baboons are important members of their ecosystems, and play a vital role in seed dispersal and pollination. They are also a key source of food for many predators, including lions and hyenas.</p>
        <p>Baboons are under threat from habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as hunting and poaching. However, their populations are generally stable, and they are not currently considered to be endangered.</p>

        <h2>LION</h2>
        <p>Lions are large cats that live in Africa and India. Male lions are easily recognized by their manes, which are large, thick tufts of hair that surround their heads. Females are smaller and do not have manes.</p>
        <p>Lions are the only cats that live in groups, called prides. A pride consists of related females, their cubs, and a few adult males. The females do most of the hunting, while the males protect the pride and cubs from other lions and predators.</p>
        <p>They are carnivores, meaning they eat only meat. Their diet consists of antelope, zebra, wildebeest, and other animals. They hunt in groups, using their powerful bodies and sharp claws and teeth to kill their prey.</p>
        <p>As an important part of the African ecosystem. They help keep populations of other animals in check, which can help prevent disease and improve the overall health of the ecosystem.</p>
        <p>Lions are in danger due to habitat loss and hunting. They are listed as a vulnerable species, which means they are at risk of becoming endangered in the future.</p>

    <h1 class="titulo">FAQ</h1>
    <dl class="faq-lista js-accordion">
      <dt>How long they live?</dt>
      <dd>In the wild, the average lifespan of an animal is just 10 years. However, in captivity, many animals can live much longer due to a lack of predators, disease, and food availability. For example, the average lifespan of a housecat is 15 years, while the average lifespan of a lion is just 10 years. The oldest recorded animal in the world was an elephant named Lin Wang who lived to be 86 years old.</dd>
      <dt>How can I help protecting?</dt>
      <dd>There are many ways that you can help protect wild animals. Some simple things that you can do are to pick up litter, recycle, and avoid using pesticides and herbicides. You can also support organizations that are working to protect habitat and to rescue and rehabilitate injured and orphaned animals. You can also spread the word to others about the importance of protecting wild animals and their habitat.</dd>
      <dt>Are they dangerous for humans?</dt>
      <dd>Some wild animals are dangerous to humans because they can carry diseases or be aggressive. Certain animals like lions, tigers, and bears are known to be more dangerous than others, but any wild animal can pose a threat to a person if it feels threatened or is sick. It’s important to be aware of your surroundings and know what kind of animals are in the area before venturing into a wild place. If you do come across a wild animal, do not approach it and try to keep your distance.</dd>
      <dt>Can I pet all of then?</dt>
      <dd>No, you cannot pet all wild animals. Some animals are simply too dangerous to approach, and others may be aggressive even if they don't pose a physical threat. In general, it's best to admire wild animals from a distance and leave them to their natural habitats.</dd>
